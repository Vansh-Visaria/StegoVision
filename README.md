# StegoVision
This Python-based application provides a user-friendly interface for performing several image processing tasks, such as text extraction from images using OCR and encoding/decoding hidden messages within images. It uses `Tkinter` for the GUI, `pytesseract` for OCR, and `Pillow` for image manipulation.
